Compiled by Aman Goel [(amangoel@umich.edu)](amangoel@umich.edu)  and  Karem A. Sakallah [(karem@umich.edu)](karem@umich.edu) , University of Michigan



#### Description
54 safety checking problems ([Ivy](https://github.com/microsoft/ivy) files, as well as in [PYV](https://github.com/wilcoxjay/mypyvy) and [VMT](http://www.vmt-lib.org/) format), that can be classified as follows:

- **paxos:** 
A set of 10 problems from [9, 10, 11]. Problems include Lamport's Paxos, Voting, simplified EPR version of Paxos from [11], etc.

- **tla:** 
A set of 5 problems converted from the TLA+ Examples repository [1, 2, 3]. Problems include transaction commit, two-phase commit, etc.

- **ex:** 
A set of 14 problems collected from various openly-available resources [4, 5, 6]. Problems include toy consensus, decentralized lock, simple election, etc.

- **i4:** 
A set of 7 problems collected from benchmark suite accompanying the tool I4 [7]. Problems include chord ring, database chain replication, two-phase commit, etc.

- **mypyv:** 
A set of 16 problems collected from benchmark suite accompanying the tool fol-ic3 [8]. Problems include hybrid reliable broadcast, learning switch, firewall, etc.

- **distai:** 
A set of 2 problems collected from benchmark suite accompanying the tool DistAI [9]. Problems include blockchain and Ricart-Agrawala.
